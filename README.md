# pi-fitch-kit

This repository documents how I combine public extensions, model-routed subagents, skills, connected MCP services, and local policy.

The kit installs public extension packages without patching [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Most work on stock Pi; `/restart` and the optional compact-view preference use public features in [my Pi fork](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi). Credentials, private provider definitions, and user-local experiments stay user-managed.

## Enabled extensions

These are the extensions loaded in my current setup. Every external extension links to its source repository.

### Orchestration and connected work

| Extension | What I use it for |
|---|---|
| [`pi-subagents`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents) | Fresh specialists, parallel work, chains, isolated worktrees, async review, durable artifacts, and coordination between local sessions |
| [`pi-mcp-adapter`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-mcp-adapter) | One searchable gateway over configured MCP servers and their tools |
| [`pi-agent-browser-native`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-browser-native) | Live documentation, browser automation, screenshots, product QA, and authenticated web flows |

### Coding and task control

| Extension | What I use it for |
|---|---|

| [`ponytail`](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) | Persistent pressure toward reuse, deletion, native features, and the smallest root-cause fix |

### Extensions bundled by this kit

[`clean-footer`](extensions/clean-footer.ts) removes cumulative token, cache, and cost counters while retaining the latest prompt cache hit rate, working directory, session name, context usage, model, thinking level, and extension statuses. The maintained [verbosity controller](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-verbosity-control) supplies the same status used by the built-in footer; the kit does not read its configuration. `/fitch-setup` upgrades the old npm controller while preserving `verbosity.json`; that older controller cannot supply this native indicator. It uses two lines when everything fits and wraps whole status items onto additional lines instead of truncating them. `/clean-footer` toggles the compact and built-in footers for comparison.

[`session-name`](extensions/session-name.ts) provides the `name_session` tool and inert session-name metadata that keep `/resume` searchable without renaming sessions for every subtask. It preserves coordinator and numbered subagent identities unless the user confirms their removal. During migration, it defers to an already loaded standalone `name_session` tool until `/fitch-setup` removes that package and Pi restarts. On Pi 0.87 and newer, metadata follows the leading system message without flattening later prompt or tool updates; older supported hosts retain the legacy context path.

[`setup-models`](extensions/setup-models.ts) provides `fitch_setup_models` for `/fitch-setup` to check requested model routes in the running session's registry. It reads the current snapshot without opening credential files, making network calls, or starting another Pi process; a trusted project's models may be present, so the results describe this session rather than proving user-global availability.

[`fast-mode`](extensions/fast-mode.ts) owns the provider fast toggles in one place. `/anthropic-fast [on|off|toggle|status]` requests Anthropic's research-preview fast mode for Opus 5 and Opus 4.8 at double the token price, with reported cost rates doubled to match; it is verified working on this setup's Claude subscription OAuth route, where identical output ran roughly 2x faster with the toggle on. `/codex-fast [on|off|toggle|status]` requests OpenAI's priority service tier on the `openai` and `openai-codex` providers, plus `cloudflare-ai-gateway` models whose id starts with `gpt-` or is `o3` or `o4-mini` (including their `2025-04-16` snapshots), through Pi's stock `before_provider_request` hook. `/fast` remains its short toggle alias, and `--fast` enables the same shared OpenAI state at startup. `/xai-fast [on|off|toggle|status]` requests the same `service_tier: "priority"` field on the `xai` provider and on `cloudflare-ai-gateway` models whose id starts with `grok-`. The gateway GPT/Grok routes are live-verified: the response echoes `service_tier: "priority"` through the gateway for `gpt-5.6-sol` and `grok-4.6`. Grok time-to-first-token is often unchanged when idle; the tier still buys queue priority under load. The `openai-codex` route is live-verified too, and it is the one that showed a large gain: on `gpt-5.6-sol`, three interleaved pairs in a single session on one account ran roughly 1.5x faster in throughput and 1.4x in completion time, with the measured medians in the 0.9.14 changelog entry. Measure that route by throughput on a fixed-length output. Time-to-first-token showed no improvement (1641ms standard against 1772ms fast). The raw returned tier was `service_tier: "default"`; that does not confirm priority processing or explain Codex backend semantics. Record requested and returned tiers separately, leaving missing returned values unknown. Sending the Codex CLI's extra `x-codex-routing-hint` header alongside the body field measured inside noise at that sample size, so the kit stays on the stock `before_provider_request` payload field alone. Reported cost is not request-doubled: Pi applies the 2x Responses multiplier when the response confirms priority (`grok-4.5`); Completions models including `grok-4.6` stay on catalog rates. Anthropic fast mode cannot ride the stock hooks: pi-ai assembles `anthropic-beta` (OAuth identity and feature markers) inside its client after extension header hooks run, and merges header sources last-write-wins, so a hook-written value would drop Pi's own markers. The extension therefore owns the `anthropic-messages` stream callback for exactly the `anthropic` and `cloudflare-ai-gateway` providers and appends the mandatory beta at fetch time, so `speed` and header travel atomically and gateway Opus gets the same toggle as the direct route. Other Opus proxies such as `github-copilot` and `opencode` stay stock, requests carrying a caller-supplied `client` stay on standard speed, and Pi-internal requests such as compaction run fast on an eligible model while the toggle is on. Toggle state lives in the shared per-user `anthropic-fast.json`, `openai-codex-fast.json`, and `xai-fast.json` files; the footer shows `priority enabled` for OpenAI and `fast` for the other toggles only while enabled on an eligible model, and follows changes made in other sessions. OpenAI notifications say `priority requests ON/OFF`; these labels describe request policy, not confirmed response handling.

Gateway o-series eligibility follows OpenAI's [Fast pricing](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing?latest-pricing=fast) and documented [o3](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/o3) / [o4-mini](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/o4-mini) snapshots. Other gateway o-series models and namespaced Workers AI models remain excluded. Local regression checks cover their serialized requests and footer state; no live gateway measurement is claimed for the o-series routes.

Accepted caveats of owning that callback: do not combine it with another Anthropic or gateway provider override without reviewing both, since Pi merges registrations last-write-wins; start a fresh Pi process after disabling or removing it, because `/reload` does not clear model-runtime provider overrides; and revalidate it when upgrading Pi, since it depends on Pi's provider composition and header-merge behavior.

[`anthropic-image-guard`](extensions/anthropic-image-guard.ts) preserves full-resolution images for other models while resizing only Claude-bound images to Anthropic's inline limits, on every route that speaks `anthropic-messages` (direct, Cloudflare AI Gateway, proxies such as GitHub Copilot). Non-Claude models sharing that wire API keep their source images.

[`write-prompt`](extensions/write-prompt.ts) adds `/draft <text>` and `/side-question <text>`. Both use the current session system prompt once and conversation off-transcript, flattening past tool-call semantics while retaining tool-result images, without replaying historical system messages or exposing tools. `/draft` rewrites the source into an agent request, then offers Accept, Copy prompt, Tweak, Restore original, or Deny. Accept sends normally when idle and steers the active agent when busy. Before sending, it saves the draft and original input in native session metadata outside model context. `/draft` without text reopens the last accepted draft on the current branch without another rewrite, including after a failed send. Restore original puts the original command back in the editor; synchronous send errors keep the dialog open for retry.

`/side-question` answers off-transcript and offers Copy answer, Ask again, or Dismiss; it never sends to the agent. Copy does not touch the editor. Both commands share the writer configuration below.

#### Draft provider, model, and thinking

By default, the writer inherits the active session's provider, model, and thinking level when rewriting starts. It uses Pi's native provider-neutral model API and configured authentication, without changing the session's settings. Pi handles provider-specific thinking mappings and output limits; the kit adds no separate output cap. Main-agent verbosity hooks are not applied.

Optional overrides live in `~/.pi/agent/write-prompt.json` (or `write-prompt.json` inside `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`). The file is read when each command first calls the writer; edits need no restart. Reopening, accepting, copying, or restoring a saved draft does not need a valid writer configuration. For example:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai-codex",
  "model": "gpt-6-astra",
  "thinkingLevel": "high"
}
```

Every field is optional. `{ "thinkingLevel": "low" }` keeps the session's provider and model; `{ "model": "gpt-6-astra" }` keeps its provider and thinking level. A provider-only override keeps the session's model ID, which must exist under the selected provider. A missing file or `{}` inherits all three values. This is separate from the defaults in Pi's `settings.json`, which initialize sessions rather than override their active selections.

The existing `{ "model": "provider/model-id" }` form remains supported when `provider` is omitted. With an explicit `provider`, `model` is the literal model ID, including any slashes.

`thinkingLevel` accepts `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. Pi adjusts unsupported levels to the selected model's capabilities and the writer reports the adjustment, including when `off` is unavailable. Malformed JSON, unknown fields, invalid values, unknown models, and missing authentication produce a named configuration error before a model call; they do not silently fall back to a different model.

**Current managed fork:** fork `afed789dded723566b6ecb1c77a06e8561504f7a` (0.87.0) owns `/restart` in its bundled launcher/worker path. The kit's legacy execve helper deliberately stays inert there because the worker is not the manifest CLI entry. Use native `/restart` (or `pi restart` from its shell tool); `/restart all` and the kit's multi-session picker are **not** supplied in this mode. Do not bypass the launcher to activate the legacy helper. See the selected host's `docs/restart.md` for native queueing, readiness, recovery, and continuation semantics.

**Legacy helper requires native activity support.** Use the Pi fork with `ctx.isBashRunning()`, `ctx.getPendingInputCount()` and `ctx.getPendingNextTurnCount()`. They expose intercepted Bash work, submitted input and queued context without relying on extension load order. Hosts without these APIs, including official Pi 0.87.0, report restart as unavailable and refuse both restart modes; they are never treated as idle.

[`session-restart`](extensions/session-restart.ts) adds `/restart` for one or several helper-enabled Pi sessions, or `/restart all`. The native picker supports Space to mark several sessions and Enter to choose. Busy sessions are skipped by default; **Stop work and restart** is a separate, explicit choice that can discard drafts, queued input, and unfinished work, and stops reported owned subagents, including background runs. Each selected process resumes its exact saved session in the same terminal, preserving its current name/model/thinking, launch options, temporary environment, and native versus virtual working directories. The initiating session restarts last. A request is counted as successful only after the replacement process confirms the expected session.

The helper runs only in a Unix Node Pi CLI with a real TTY, not SDK/RPC/print hosts, Bun, or native binaries. Unsaved and ephemeral sessions stay untouched. Native activity remains visible on first activation through `/reload`, including Bash and input dispatch started before the helper loaded. An unknown original `--api-key` provider still requires a fresh Pi start rather than guessing its binding. Ordinary reloads retain the process-image identity. Child activity is checked through loaded `pi-subagents`; a missing expected bridge blocks restart, while a genuinely absent integration is not applicable—not a claim that arbitrary external jobs were checked. Private sockets live under the system temp directory; `PI_FITCH_RESTART_DIR` can select a short, private shared directory. No daemon, terminal keystrokes, or argv/credential journal is involved. [Restart details and limits](docs/pi-setup.md#restarting-pi-sessions) explain the lifecycle and preservation boundaries.

### Native working-session checkpoints

On Pi forks supporting `session_checkpoint`, fast-mode qualifies its existing file-backed toggles after native-owned work settles; the private filesystem archive must include those three files. There is no in-memory toggle to flush. Read failures retain the existing off fallback, and failed command writes are still reported normally.

Clean-footer saves only its enabled boolean in a native `clean-footer-checkpoint` entry. Cold startup restores the latest file-wide checkpoint choice for that session ID, not a global or branch preference. `/tree` still leaves the current choice alone; warm reload/new/resume/fork still create an enabled instance, and copied checkpoint entries do not transfer the parent session's choice to a fork. This is checkpoint state, not a promise to persist every toggle between checkpoints. Footer statistics and native extension statuses are reconstructible presentation, not extra working state to serialize or block on. Fast-mode retains its file-watcher teardown. Older Pi hosts ignore the additive event and keep their existing behavior.

### Optional compact view

On a supporting Pi runtime, `/compact-view` switches between compact tool cards and the normal view. `/compact-view on` and `/compact-view off` choose explicitly. The change applies immediately to the current session and is remembered for new sessions; other open sessions are unchanged. Individual tool cards remain expandable by click in fullscreen mode, and Ctrl+O still expands or collapses all tools.

The fork defaults to off. [`examples/settings.json`](examples/settings.json) includes `"compactView": true` as my optional preference, which `/fitch-setup` offers separately only when the installed runtime supports it. Installing the kit never enables it. Official Pi without this feature remains supported and skips this setting. Core owns the view; `pi-subagents` follows it for routine coordination notices. The kit adds no rendering extension and changes no tool results or model context.

### Selective experimental extension

[`macuse`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/macuse) adds native macOS application inspection and control when a browser DOM or CLI is not enough. I enable it only for tasks that need native app automation. It is intentionally marked experimental because Codex app updates can break the integration surface.

### User-local extensions

Personal provider definitions, agent-profile overrides, and experimental extensions remain outside Complete core. My main session uses `openai-codex/gpt-6-astra` at max reasoning with a 600k context budget; this is distinct from the public direct-OpenAI example below. Personal Posthorse provides fresh context windows through fork APIs and is not an official-Pi fallback or a kit dependency. Setup preserves these choices and never copies private configuration into the public package.

### Why the image guard exists

Pi defaults `images.autoResize` to `true`, which protects provider limits by shrinking every image to at most 2000×2000. I disable it globally so vision-capable agents can inspect the original detail:

```json
{
  "images": {
    "autoResize": false
  }
}
```

That exposed stricter Anthropic image limits. The bundled guard fixes the boundary instead of giving up source quality everywhere: it runs only on Claude models over the `anthropic-messages` API regardless of which provider routes them, reuses Pi's native image resizer, keeps eight recent successful transformations, clears that cache on compaction, and retries later after resize failures. Before native decoding, it omits sources above 32 MiB of base64 and admits the newest images within a 64 MiB source budget, preserving conversation order and saved originals. On the bundled direct Anthropic and Cloudflare routes, and in writer calls, it also budgets the complete serialized request against Anthropic's 32 MB limit, including text and tool definitions. It resizes images further when needed, omitting oldest images first only when resizing cannot fit them; text/tool-only overflow retains native handling. The complete safe settings subset is in [`examples/settings.json`](examples/settings.json).

## Subagent bench

[`pi-subagents`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents) supplies both the orchestration runtime and the opinionated defaults: sixteen specialist profiles plus its general-purpose `delegate`. This kit uses that package instead of owning duplicate copies.

| Job | Profiles |
|---|---|
| Map and investigate | [`scout`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/scout.md), [`context-builder`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/context-builder.md), [`debugger`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/debugger.md), [`researcher`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/researcher.md) |
| Monitor changing state | [`watcher`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/watcher.md) |
| Decide and plan | [`planner`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/planner.md), [`oracle`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/oracle.md) |
| Implement bounded work | [`worker`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/worker.md), [`fixer`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/fixer.md) |
| Challenge the result | [`reviewer`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/reviewer.md), [`reviewer-gpt`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/reviewer-gpt.md), [`reviewer-claude`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/reviewer-claude.md), [`reviewer-security`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/reviewer-security.md), [`reviewer-ponytail`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/reviewer-ponytail.md), [`ui-designer`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/ui-designer.md) |
| Human-facing output | [`writer`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/blob/main/agents/writer.md) |

The parent session remains responsible for the task. Specialists return evidence; they do not become an autonomous hierarchy.

The exact primary, fallback, thinking, context, tool, and output policy lives in [`pi-subagents/agents`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/tree/main/agents). The generic delegate inherits the parent model. User and project profiles can override the packaged defaults; setup preserves those files and previews the actual resolved mapping rather than copying a second routing table. Cross-model reviews and explicit provider choices remain available.

## Active skills

Skills load task-specific operating instructions only when the work matches. [`pi-agent-skills`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills) carries the active reusable workflow set:

| Skill | What it adds |
|---|---|
| [`ask-clarifying-questions`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/ask-clarifying-questions) | Stop only for ambiguity that materially changes scope, safety, or reversibility |
| [`bro`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/bro) | User-invoked plain-language rewrite with no jargon |
| [`deslop`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/deslop) | Remove AI-generated diff noise and ceremonial test tables without dropping real boundary coverage |
| [`diagram-creation`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/diagram-creation) | Create editable D2 architecture, sequence, data-flow, dependency, lifecycle, and before/after diagrams with rendered SVG/PNG review artifacts |
| [`dogfood`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/dogfood) | Exploratory QA through real browser and terminal/TUI flows |
| [`pi-extension-development`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/pi-extension-development) | Build, debug, validate, package, and release Pi extensions against current runtime contracts |
| [`propose-then-ship-pi`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/propose-then-ship-pi) | Rank one repository improvement, stop for direction, then implement, review, and ship it |
| [`tdd`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/tdd) | Red-green-refactor when test-first behavior is explicitly required |
| [`thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review) | Strict maintainability review for large or structurally risky diffs |
| [`ux-review`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/ux-review) | Review user-visible workflows for completion, recovery, progress, and truthful outcomes |
| [`verification-before-completion`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-agent-skills/tree/main/skills/verification-before-completion) | Require current evidence before completion, commit, PR, or passing-check claims |

Companion skills ship beside their extensions:

| Source | Skills |
|---|---|
| [`pi-subagents`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-subagents/tree/main/skills) | `pi-subagents` orchestration and `pi-intercom` coordination guidance |
| [`pi-mcp-adapter`](https://github.com/fitchmultz/pi-mcp-adapter/tree/main/skills/mcp-scripting) | `mcp-scripting` for discovering and composing MCP calls |
| [`ponytail`](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail/tree/main/skills) | `ponytail`, `ponytail-review` (my runtime filters the audit, debt, gain, and help variants) |

`bro` is intentionally user-invoked only. My runtime filters the packaged `handoff` skill because subagent artifacts and Intercom cover that path; unfiltered `pi-agent-skills` installs still include it. The rest are selected by task fit rather than loaded into every prompt.

## Connected MCP services

MCP is the context and action bus around the coding loop. Authentication is per-user and is never stored in this repository.

The current setup has authenticated, read-only-discovery-verified connections for:

| Connection | Capability |
|---|---|
| `horizon` | Internal integration gateway, authenticated identity, integration API calls, and nested tool catalogs |
| GitHub | Repositories, issues, pull requests, checks, reviews, releases, and code search |
| Linear | Issues, projects, teams, and planning context |
| Slack, primary and development workspaces | Public and approved private conversation context, threads, users, and canvases |
| Cloudflare | Documentation plus typed account API access |
| Sentry | Issues, events, traces, releases, and project context |
| Datadog | Dashboards, monitors, metrics, logs, traces, and operational context |
| Plain | Support threads, customers, workspace data, and Sidekick sessions |
| Notion | Workspace search, pages, databases, comments, and meeting notes |
| Granola | Meeting notes, summaries, folders, and transcripts |

The organization-specific endpoint and authentication configuration stay private. [`setup-manifest.json`](setup-manifest.json) records only the service choices; `/fitch-setup` stops for each user's own login and never probes by reading service data. My personal runtime is fully approved: MCP is a tool transport, not an authorization layer, so operating boundaries come from the working agreement and the human directing the session. The optional `mcp_script` mode is trusted local code execution when enabled, not a sandbox or an authorization boundary. The setup configures only integrations listed in the manifest and never persists mutable npm specs such as `@latest`.

## How the workflow fits together

A typical substantial change looks like this:

1. The main session reads repository instructions and pulls the relevant issue or service context through MCP.
2. Native repository search and, when useful, a fresh `scout` map the real code path before editing.
3. The main session makes the design decision and usually implements it with the editor package's mutation tools; independent `worker` tasks are the exception, not the default.
4. Agent Browser verifies browser-visible behavior when tests cannot prove the user experience.
5. Repository checks and deterministic tools establish current evidence.
6. A fresh reviewer reconstructs the claim from the diff and evidence. Any changed diff gets a new reviewer pass; old reviewer judgment is never cached as sign-off.
7. The main session closes the loop, records remaining risk, and performs only the external actions the user authorized.

The architecture stays modular:

```text
Pi core
  ├─ public extensions and tools
  ├─ bounded, model-routed subagents
  ├─ task-selected skills and policy
  └─ user-authenticated MCP services
```

This is already the working composition layer for a broader organization harness. Productizing it would add centralized provisioning, policy distribution, scoped credential brokerage, audit and cost visibility, managed local/cloud execution, and multi-user controls. It would not require turning the extensions into a monolith or locking the harness to one model provider.

## Install the kit

The kit requires Node.js 24 or newer and Pi 0.84.2 or newer. Selected external packages can require newer Pi versions: `pi-apply-edits` 1.0 requires Pi 0.87.0 or newer. When using that editor with `pi-subagents`, use subagents 0.39.1 or newer so completion tracking recognizes the new editing tools and partial-error receipts. Setup checks each selected package's documented requirements before installing. `/restart` additionally requires the Pi fork's native activity APIs described above; installing the kit does not patch or replace Pi.

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
pi
# Complete provider login in Pi, then:
pi install git:github.com/fitchmultz/pi-fitch-kit
# Start a fresh Pi process, then:
/fitch-setup
```

`/fitch-setup` reads [`setup-manifest.json`](setup-manifest.json), previews every package install and file change, and asks which parts to apply. It checks models through the running session's read-only `fitch_setup_models` tool, rather than starting a Pi CLI whose migrations can change files. It never reads or copies credentials. Reruns normalize filtered, pinned, or duplicate kit entries to one canonical source. They also preview removal of retired standalone packages, the archived Intercom package, approved Fold footer and fast-mode loader symlinks, and legacy kit-owned profile symlinks; symlink cleanup never removes regular files or links from another source. A separate consent step merges the manifest's flat context-window overrides into `models.json` per route, keeping existing values unless explicitly overwritten. `/fitch-setup verify` reports all drift without changing anything.

The manifest is the source of truth for package channels, models, bundled resources, and optional service connections. It keeps the released `pi-agent-browser-native` wrapper paired with its tested Agent Browser 0.36.0 baseline. [`examples/settings.json`](examples/settings.json) is a safe subset of my behavioral settings, not a credential-bearing config dump. It selects direct OpenAI Astra at max reasoning for the public setup; optional routes are filtered by availability. The manifest retains the public 320k context budgets. Existing personal choices, including Codex Astra and 600k, remain unchanged unless explicitly selected for replacement.

## Prompts

The package registers only two prompts:

- `/fitch-setup` for installing or verifying the kit.
- `/github-open-issues-prs` for the one prompt-backed operational flow still on my normal path.

The older prompt files remain in `prompts/` as source material, but the package does not load them. Nothing is deleted; they simply no longer dominate autocomplete or the README.

## Trust and security boundaries

- Pi extensions run with the permissions of the user who started Pi. Project trust is not a sandbox.
- My personal setup runs with full approvals and does not put a confirmation dialog in front of each MCP call. The working agreement is model policy, not a technical authorization boundary.
- Every person authenticates their own model providers and services.
- The kit contains no keys, OAuth state, private endpoints, browser profiles, raw sessions, generated catalogs, or copied service responses.
- Extension packages use bare Git or npm sources. Agent Browser's separate CLI prerequisite stays on the wrapper's tested upstream version.
- The settings example deliberately omits personal paths, package filters, credentials, and the trust default. Choose project trust explicitly.
- External writes, deployments, merges, account changes, and production actions remain user-authorized decisions.

## Validation

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check:compat
```

- `npm run check:compat` reuses `check` plus `smoke` against the actually installed host graph. The exact official development cohort is 0.87.0, separate from the advertised 0.84.2 Pi floor. Node **>=24** remains required. The compatibility runner selects independent official/fork SDK, declaration and CLI graphs; lifecycle checks use the manifest's bundled bin, never Pi from PATH. This does not install the full setup-manifest composition or run paid providers.
- `npm run check` type-checks and syntax-checks the bundled extensions, exercises the image guard boundary, the fast toggles, session naming, writer commands, and restart argument/activity/protocol boundaries, then validates unpinned package sources, manifest resources, package metadata alignment, the absence of retired patch and duplicate surfaces, the settings example's model, retry, and compaction consistency, and that every enabled or context-window route is manifest-managed with room for the configured compaction reserve and recent context. It also runs the validator against invalid manifest and compaction inputs; policy values live in the manifest and settings example rather than a second frozen validator table.
- `npm run regression:clean-footer` loads the real footer with an offline SDK session. It checks file-wide names and cache hit rates across redraws, append, rename, branch extraction, reload, and new sessions; live context, model, theme, and wrapping stay fresh. Hosts with `getEntriesRevision()` skip unchanged entry scans. On the fork it also acquires a real native checkpoint and checks persisted footer state; `PI_COMPAT_HOST=fork` requires the checkpoint and restart activity APIs rather than silently skipping. An optional host-root argument supports focused read-only SDK probing, not declaration qualification.
- `npm run regression:fast-mode` verifies the fast toggles at the wire through real pi-ai serialization: `speed` plus fetch-time beta append on direct and gateway Opus routes without dropping existing markers, beta deduplication, prebuilt-client bypass, full-stream option survival, OpenAI and xAI priority via the native-loaded request hook, supported gateway o3/o4-mini aliases and snapshots through the real gateway serializer, unsupported-model and cross-toggle isolation, off-state passthrough, matching footer eligibility, and watcher cleanup.
- `npm run regression:session-name` verifies naming, metadata injection, protected identities, single ownership during migration, and the native system-aware versus historical context paths.
- `npm run regression:write-prompt` verifies provider/model/thinking inheritance, full and partial overrides, configuration errors, native thinking adjustment, idle/busy acceptance, synchronous send failure and original-input recovery, accept/deny, boxed rewrite instructions, `/side-question` ask-again history, session-prefix rewriting, reusable tweak history, and activity throughout calls/dialogs and reload. It also loads the real extension into offline SDK sessions and checks native completion/HTTP serialization for single-copy instructions, no tools, flattened history with retained screenshots, Responses/Codex serialization, native idle delivery and busy steering, asynchronous send failure with saved-draft retry, file-backed resume, fresh sessions, and new-context rollover where supported (required when `PI_COMPAT_HOST=fork`). Run `node scripts/write-prompt-boundary.mjs <pi-coding-agent-package-root>` to check another installed or built Pi host; only HTTP responses and dialogs are stubbed.
- `npm run regression:session-restart` checks native argument round-trips, paged child status/stopping, socket identity, and native single/multiple/all selection. Set `PI_SUBAGENTS_SOURCE` to a local owning-package checkout to also exercise its actual bridge, executor, restored ownership, and foreground/background stop routes with synthetic child processes—not agents.
- `npm run smoke` loads the checkout through Pi's real resource loader, renders the compact footer at wide and narrow widths, checks its toggle and in-session model status against legacy-file fixtures, and requires seven non-TTY commands, `name_session`, `fitch_setup_models`, one provider request hook, seven extensions, and two prompts. `/restart` remains inert in this SDK host and is exercised in the real TTY check.
- `npm run smoke:lifecycle` uses an isolated Pi agent dir for real install, stale-filter and duplicate-identity normalization, and resource reload; it also checks that installation leaves compact view unset and reinstall preserves an explicit opt-out.

For the current managed fork, run `npm run smoke:restart -- --cases managed --pi-root <selected-package-root> --output <new-results-dir> --runtime-dir <new-short-private-dir>`. This actual bundled-CLI PTY test requires a distinct launcher/worker, checks a new worker resumes the same session without replaying startup input, and confirms that the kit does not take over native restart. Official refusal uses `--cases unsupported`. These Unix PTY checks are separate from portable `check:compat` and are not native Windows qualification.

For the legacy unsupervised helper only, `npm run smoke:restart -- --pi-root <built-fork-packages/coding-agent> --output <new-results-dir> --runtime-dir <new-short-private-dir>` runs real Pi PTY checks using Python 3, synthetic saved sessions, Pi's built-in faux provider, and owned processes only. It covers repeated restart, current state/key binding, tree/root preservation, busy skipping and stopping, intercepted Bash, queued nextTurn context, pending input handlers, input retained after tree cancellation, late activation, malformed requests, termination/exec failures, and actual single/multiple/all UI. The harness creates cleared child environments; no paid model calls are needed. Both output paths must be new, and the runtime socket path must fit the platform's Unix-socket limit. Run it from an isolated outer HOME/agent/XDG environment too. Add `--session-cwd --cases preserve,virtual,separator --virtual-source <pi-change-working-dir checkout>` to check distinct native cwd, separator behavior and the actual virtual-cwd extension. Against an older host, use `--cases unsupported` to verify truthful refusal, not compatibility.
